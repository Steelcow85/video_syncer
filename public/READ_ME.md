********* IMPORTANT *********
to run properly, clientVIdeos.js and masterVideo.js (in scripts folder) needs to be updated with your server's current IP address!

1. run node server.js on your desktop

2. run index.html in your desktop browser- this is used to send the reset message to the server

3. run client_03_horiz.html on your phone <'your server's IP address>:3000/client_03_horiz.html
